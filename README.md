# Blood Group Tail App


## About
I made this app for YouthForBlood's “Blood Group Tail” campaign. It is a campaign to aware people about “blood group” through Social networking sites. Educating and encouraging people to donate blood has been a matter of serious concern for us. We still have a condition where friends within our circle are still unaware about their blood group.

The app is live at [www.bgt.youthforblood.org](http://bgt.youthforblood.org)

I also made a tutorial video on how to use this app. Watch it on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sK-cSGIk8K0) here
